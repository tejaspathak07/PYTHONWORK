# PYTHONWORK
Hello, everyone! Have you ever wondered how well-known financial apps like iMobile and YONO function behind the scenes?
Today, I want to share something exciting with you.

Inspire by these well-known applications, I developed a real-world banking application with some amazing features. 

In this code, I've defined a BankAccount class that represents a user's bank account. It has three main functionalities: 
A. checking the account balance, 
B. depositing funds, and
C. withdrawing funds.

When you call check_balance(), it displays the current balance.
Depositing funds is done through the deposit() method, which adds the specified amount to the account balance. 
Withdrawing funds is done using the withdraw() method, which deducts the specified amount from the account balance, given that sufficient funds are available. If there are insufficient funds, an appropriate message is displayed.

I'm thrilled about this project and how it simulates the functionality of real banking applications.
It's a great way to understand the underlying code and appreciate the complexity involved in creating such robust systems.

Let me know your thoughts!
